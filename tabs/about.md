I am a technology expert with more than 15 yearsâ€™ experience in the IT industry. During that time, I gained hands-on experience in architecting and deploying solutions for different sizes of organizations across many industries and sectors. 

With my strong technical skills as well as excellent interpersonal skills, I can develop and coordinate cloud architecture between IT and business operations, translate the business requirements into technical solutions and help clients in their successful cloud journey.  In a team environment, I am both a natural team leader and a productive team member. 

I hold B.Sc in Computer Science, Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification from Microsoft, and Professional Cloud Architect certification from Google.

In my free time, I enjoy running but only when the weather is nice ðŸ˜Š
