My name is Aleksandar Stefanov. Currently, I work as a Senior Consultant/Cloud Architect at Devoteam Netherlands. At my current and previous employer, I gain experience working with a broad profile of clients, improving their overall efficiency by leveraging Azure service offerings. 

I hold B.Sc in Computer Science, Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification from Microsoft, and Professional Cloud Architect certification from Google.

In my free time, I enjoy running but only when the weather is nice ðŸ˜Š

To find out more details on my work experience, please visit my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandarstefanov/) profile.

Opinions on this site are my own.

And yes, Iâ€™m a big fan of the Bing Bang Theory
